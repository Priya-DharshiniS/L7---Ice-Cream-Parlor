**Frosty Delights**

This project is a simple Tkinter-based ice cream parlor management app that allows users to view available seasonal ice cream flavors, add items to a cart, and manage allergies. The app also includes a backend database (SQLite) to store flavors and cart items. Users can interact with the app by selecting flavors to add to their cart, viewing the cart's contents, and setting allergy preferences to filter flavors accordingly. The app uses a clean and intuitive UI with options for searching, adding, and managing flavors.

**Steps to run**
Step 1: Run the command: git clone <repository_url> 
Step 2: Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.x). 
        Install Tkinter (if not already installed) via pip install tk. 
        SQLite comes pre-installed with Python, so no additional installation is required.  
Step 3: Run cd <project_folder> to go to the cloned project directory. 
Step 4: Execute the command: python app.py to start the application.  
Step 5: The app should open in a new window, and you can start interacting with the features. 
Step 6: You can modify or add new seasonal flavors directly in the SQLite database (ice_cream.db).
